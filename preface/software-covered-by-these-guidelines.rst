Software covered by these guidelines
-----------------------------------------

In order to dispel any interpretative doubts, in the context of
Articles 68 and 69 of the CAD, the terms ‘programs', 'solutions',
'computer programs' and 'ICT solutions' are to be understood as the
same. The subject matter of the obligation laid down by the provision in
question is 'software'. A non-exhaustive list of software thus covered
by these guidelines includes the following:

-  Web applications (front-end and back-end)

-  Desktop applications

-  Mobile applications

-  Semi-finished applications and components

-  Frameworks

-  Libraries

-  Plug-ins

-  Operating systems

-  Websites (front-end and back-end)

These guidelines are intended for encouraging the rationalisation of
solutions used in sectors/services familiar to public administrations,
such as, for example, human resources management, document management
and storage, management of decision-making processes, institutional
communication and administrative transparency.

Furthermore, it is important to note that the term 'software', as used
in this document, refers not only to the source and/or executable code,
but also to all artefacts produced during the process of developing and
using software, i.e. documentation, graphical assets, manuals, etc., as
explained in Article 69(1).
