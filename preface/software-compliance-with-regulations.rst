Software compliance with regulations
--------------------------------------

Reusing software amplifies any selection made within the information
technology field and is completely neutral with respect to the quality
or lack thereof of selections made. It can multiply the impact of good
practice or, in the same way, negatively enhance the impact of erroneous
choices whose dissemination is undesirable.

In promoting the reuse and dissemination of software over which the
intellectual property rights of an administration are emphasised, along
with the important economic and efficiency advantage, it is crucial to
draw the attention of individual administrations to the importance of
the software being reused - as with the entire software range used by
each administration - complying with the regulations in force.

Since the process of acquiring software for reuse often includes
customisations and aggregations of different components, some of which
may no longer be in use or were released years earlier, it is important
to remember that the verification of full compliance with the regulatory
framework remains the responsibility of the administration that reuses
the software, since it alone is responsible for decisions taken within
the assigned margins of discretion and in accordance with the
constitutional principles of good performance.
