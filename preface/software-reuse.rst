The 'reuse' of software refers to the set of activities carried out to
enable the software to be used within a different context from that for
which it was originally created, in order to satisfy requirements
similar to those that led to its initial development. The original
product is 'transported' into its new context, enriched, if necessary,
with additional functionalities and technical characteristics that may
represent 'added value' for its users.

Through the combined provisions of ArticlesÂ 68 and 69 of the CAD,
software for reuse is exclusively that released under open licence by a
public administration. Therefore, this is a subset of all open source
software available for acquisition. These guidelines distinguish, where
appropriate, the methods in which public administration software under
an open licence is acquired, in comparison to third-party open source
software.

A fundamental condition of reuse in the context of public
administrations is that an administration that 'reuses' software
receives it free of charge from the transferring administration, and in
acquiring it only incurs the costs of its adaptation, not those of
design and implementation.
