Introduction and legislative context
---------------------------------------

Article 69(1) defines the **obligation**, for public administrations
that own software designed to the specifications of the public client,
'*to make the relevant source code available, complete with
documentation and released in a public repository under an open licence,
free of charge for other public administrations or legal entities that
intend to adapt it to their own requirements*'.

The new wording of Article 69(2) and (2a), below, stresses the aim of
encouraging reuse by taking steps to ensure that '*the awarding
administration shall always hold all rights to the programs and services
of the information and communication technologies specifically developed
for it', 'unless this is excessively onerous for proven technical and
economic reasons’ and that 'the source code, the documentation and the
relative functional technical description of all the IT solutions*. *.*
. a\ *re published through one or more platforms identified by AgID with
its own guidelines to be adopted pursuant to Article 71*'.
