Developers Italia and identifying software for reuse
------------------------------------------------------

The reuse model outlined above is made possible by AgID's Developers
Italia platform.

Within the platform, there is a section dedicated to software made
available for reuse by administrations. In particular:

-  A 'search engine' is available to identify software for reuse.
   Through this engine, the administration can search for free software
   released on the internet by other administrations, using consultation
   tools made available by the platform (e.g. filters by type of
   software, type of administration);

-  Within Developers Italia, you can ‘register’ the administration
   software released in open source mode for reuse, so that it can be
   easily identified by other administrations.
