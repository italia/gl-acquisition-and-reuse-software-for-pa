Process of making software available for reuse under open licence
------------------------------------------------------------------

The process of making software available for reuse is as follows:

1. The administration identifies a **code hosting tool**. Once the tool
   has been identified, it can be utilised for all software that is to
   be reused (`3.4.1 Identifying a code hosting
   tool <#_Toc535583350>`__).

2. The administration chooses an open licence to use (`3.5 Open licences
   and choice of licence <#_Toc535583353>`__).

3. The administration, using its own resources or through procurement,
   publishes the complete source code of the software and the relevant
   technical documentation on the code hosting tool. This technological
   process is described in `Annex A: Guide to publishing software as
   open source <#_bookmark65>`__, attached to these guidelines. The
   guide is written in such a way that it can be attached to a tender
   technical specification, to facilitate the acquisition of a service
   by entrusting the supplier with the obligations required by these
   guidelines.

4. The administration shall 'register' the software on the Developers
   Italia platform, so that it is indexed by the search engine and made
   visible to other administrations looking for reusable software.

The process outlined here is valid for existing software owned by
administrations (`3.6 Releasing <#_Toc535583357>`__\ `existing software
under open licence <#_Toc535583357>`__), as well as for software that
will be developed in the future (`3.7 Development of
software <#_Toc535583358>`__\ `from scratch <#_Toc535583358>`__).

Identifying a code hosting tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The release of software must be carried out through a code hosting tool,
which is specialised in hosting and making distributed software
available under an open licence. There are many solutions on the market,
both free and commercial.

Since the purpose of Article 69(1) is to encourage reuse between
administrations, the tool must follow best practices in terms of
functionality for the publication of the source code, in order not to
create additional costs for administrations hoping to find and use the
software.

In particular, the tool must at least have the following functions:

-  Free read access to the source code, without authentication;

-  Free and unobstructed registration, open to the public;

-  A web interface for viewing and browsing the code and its
   documentation;

-  The use of a version control system with the functionality of
   managing parallel branches of development;

-  An issue tracker system open to the public for read access without
   authentication and for write access following authentication;

-  Implementation of at least one flow for sending modifications, code
   review and integration of the modification, fully managed by the
   tool, open to the public;

-  A release management system;

-  Availability of an API to interface with the tool and extract data
   and metadata related to the repositories.

To simplify the choice, in `Annex A: Guide to publishing software as
open source <#_bookmark65>`__ there is a non-exhaustive list of the main
platforms on the market that meet the requirements.

Some platforms fully adhering to the minimum parameters are available in
SaaS mode (i.e. they can be used directly via the internet without
having to install a copy on a server), without any licence cost and
without the need to sign contracts or conventions; selecting one of
these SaaS platforms is therefore to be considered preferential, in the
event that there are no other technical constraints (e.g. integration
requirements), so as not to create direct or indirect costs for the
administration.

The administration must choose a tool (or tools, where justified for
organisational purposes) on which to release all the software it owns.
Alternatively, in `Annex A: Guide to
publishing <#_bookmark65>`__\ `software as open
source, <#_bookmark65>`__\ an alternative process is outlined that
leaves the choice to the party responsible for developing the software
and/or releasing it on behalf of the administration (whether this party
corresponds to a resource that is internal or external to the
administration).

Once one or more code hosting tools have been selected, the
administration must provide adequate visibility of the tools on its web
page, as detailed in the same guide (`Registration of
the <#_Toc535583380>`__\ `repository on Developers
Italia <#_Toc535583380>`__).

Registration of open software on Developers Italia
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Software released by the administration must be 'registered' in the
search engine of Developers Italia, to facilitate access by other
administrations that are looking for reusable software.

The precise technical process for registration is indicated in the
section `Registering the repository on <#_Toc535583380>`__\ `Developers
Italia <#_Toc535583380>`__.

Responsibilities related to the release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administration that owns the software does not incur any specific
obligation related to the release: it is not necessary to provide a
warranty with the software, technical or user level support, nor
financially support administrations that reuse the software as regards
costs or adoption procedures.
