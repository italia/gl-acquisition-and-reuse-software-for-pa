Process of making software available for reuse under open licence
------------------------------------------------------------------

The process of making software available for reuse is as follows:

1. The administration identifies a **code hosting tool**. Once the tool
   has been identified, it can be utilised for all software that is to
   be reused (`3.4.1 Identifying a code hosting
   tool <#_Toc535583350>`__).

2. The administration chooses an open licence to use (`3.5 Open licences
   and choice of licence <#_Toc535583353>`__).

3. The administration, using its own resources or through procurement,
   publishes the complete source code of the software and the relevant
   technical documentation on the code hosting tool. This technological
   process is described in `AnnexÂ A: Guide to publishing software as
   open source <#_bookmark65>`__, attached to these guidelines. The
   guide is written in such a way that it can be attached to a tender
   technical specification, to facilitate the acquisition of a service
   by entrusting the supplier with the obligations required by these
   guidelines.

4. The administration shall 'register' the software on the Developers
   Italia platform, so that it is indexed by the search engine and made
   visible to other administrations looking for reusable software.

The process outlined here is valid for existing software owned by
administrations (`3.6 Releasing <#_Toc535583357>`__\ `existing software
under open licence <#_Toc535583357>`__), as well as for software that
will be developed in the future (`3.7 Development of
software <#_Toc535583358>`__\ `from scratch <#_Toc535583358>`__).
