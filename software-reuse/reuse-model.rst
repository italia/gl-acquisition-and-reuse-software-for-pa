Reuse model
------------

The reuse model outlined by the CAD is described in detail below. Each
point of the following flow is specified in a later section of this
document.

**Development phase**

1. Administration ‘A’, by carrying out the comparative assessment
   provided for by Article 68, according to that described in the
   *acquisition* section, decides that, to meet its requirements, it
   must resort to the full implementation of from-scratch software or
   customise existing open source software.

2. Administration 'A' uses its own resources and/or makes use of
   procurement to develop the software. In the case of procurement, as
   required by Article 69(2), the administration guarantees the
   acquisition of ownership of all intellectual and industrial property
   rights over the commissioned software(\ `1.5
   Ownership <#_Toc535583316>`__).

3. During the course of the software development and/or at its
   conclusion, the administration publishes the source code of its
   software under an open licence, on a platform that meets the
   requirements identified in these guidelines (`3.4.1 Identifying a
   code hosting tool <#_Toc535583350>`__), then registers its release
   within Developers Italia (`3.7 Developing software from
   scratch <#_Toc535583358>`__).

**Reuse phase**

1. Administration ‘B’, which needs such software, during the comparative
   assessment phase, finds the software made available for reuse by
   administration ‘A’, within Developers Italia (`2.5.1 Phase 2.1:
   Identifying reusable solutions for the PA <#_Toc535583331>`__).

2. The open licence allows administration 'B' to acquire and use the
   software of administration ‘A’ without having to sign a convention,
   subject to the terms of the licence.

3. Administration ‘B’ carries out an assessment of the status of the
   software and its applicability to its own needs (`2.5.2 Phase 2.2:
   Assessment of reusable solutions for the PA <#_Toc535583332>`__),
   including the possible need for customisation.

4. If the software is customised, where possible, such customisation (as
   developed on the specific instructions of administration ‘B’) is also
   subject to the provisions of Article 69(1), and therefore the
   relevant source code must be released under an **open licence** (
   `3.9 Reuse of software or use of open source
   software <#_Toc535583366>`__).

The reuse model through open source software allows for software to be
found, assessed and customised **without entering into a convention**
with the administration that made the software available for reuse, as
well the acceptance of the open source licence that is carried out
through a simple download. Furthermore, the software is available online
and therefore no access request is required.

However, it is important to consider that the software may not be 'ready
to use'. The administration may therefore require technical intervention
to install the software, adapt it to its requirements, train staff who
will use it, and ensure that support and maintenance services are
available. For all these interventions, the administration **may use its
own resources or supplies**, since no obligation from this point of view
is imposed on the administration that created the software and made it
available for reuse.
