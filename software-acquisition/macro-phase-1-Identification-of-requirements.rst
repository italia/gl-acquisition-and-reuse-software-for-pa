Macro-phase 1: Identification of requirements
----------------------------------------------

In this macro-phase, the public administration defines the requirements
(needs and constraints) that affect the options for the identification
of a solution; it is recommended to prepare a document (without any
format restrictions) describing the identified requirements to be used
in phases that relate to the comparison and assessment of solutions.

Phase 1.1: Needs analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administration defines its own needs for the identification of the
software solution. In doing so, it takes into account that defined in
the Acquisition programme and in the Public works planning (Article 21
of Legislative Decree No 50 of 18 April 2016).

The activities anticipated in this phase are:

-  an analysis of the context through the description of the
   characteristics of the administration: purpose, structure and
   organisation;

-  a description of the operational flows involved in the software to be
   acquired, which the public administration puts in place as a
   follow-up to the administrative procedures;

-  the optimisation assumptions for the flows in relation to the
   software to be acquired;

-  identification of the 'tools' (definition of objectives) needed to
   implement the identified operational processes;

-  declaration of requirements, i.e. the needs to which the software
   must respond, providing for a differentiation between indispensable
   and non-essential requirements.

This phase concludes with the:

-  identification of the needs of the public administration.

Phase 1.2: Identification of constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administration shall describe the constraints that will affect the
supply of the software solution. The activities anticipated in this
phase are:

-  identification of the **budget resources available** (hereinafter
   T\ :sub:`budget`) to ensure the availability and production of the
   solution to be acquired (possible data reclamation and migration from
   existing systems, installation, customisation, integration with
   existing systems, training, start-up support, management activities,
   payment of any surplus, etc.);

-  estimate of the **time required to implement the solution**
   (hereinafter referred to as T\ :sub:`time`), which the public
   administration can absorb;

-  any standards and guidelines that the software should follow in its
   technical implementation, such as for example:

   -  `AgID Design guidelines <https://designers.italia.it/guide/>`__
      (which also includes compliance with Law No 4/2004 on
      accessibility);

   -  AgID interoperability guidelines;

   -  `AgiD guidelines on the development of secure
      software <https://www.agid.gov.it/it/sicurezza/cert-pa/linee-guida-sviluppo-del-software-sicuro>`__.

-  any other constraints of interest of the administration.

This phase concludes with the:

-  identification of constraints (economic and time-related) that affect
   the choices of the administration.

Phase 1.3: Drafting of the document describing the requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administration shall draft a document describing its requirements to
be used in the subsequent stages of the comparative assessment.

The activities anticipated in this phase are:

-  drafting of the document describing the requirements, which shall
   contain the results of the previous phases 1.1 and 1.2.

This phase concludes with the:

-  availability of the document describing the requirements.
