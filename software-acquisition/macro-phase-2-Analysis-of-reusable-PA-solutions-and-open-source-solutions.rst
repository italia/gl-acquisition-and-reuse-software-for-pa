In order to rationalise the overall expenditure of public
administrations, the verification process to ensure that requirements
have been satisfied must first consider 'reusable PA solutions' and then
'open source solutions'.

The implementation of `Article 69 of the
CAD <http://www.normattiva.it/atto/caricaArticolo?art.progressivo=0&art.idArticolo=69&art.versione=4&art.codiceRedazionale=005G0104&art.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2005-05-16&atto.tipoProvvedimento=DECRETO LEGISLATIVO&art.idGruppo=14&a>`__
ensures that 'reusable PA solutions' make the relative source code
available, complete with documentation, in a public repository under an
open licence.

For further information, please refer to `3 Guidelines for software
reuse (Article 69) <#_bookmark38>`__.

Phase 2.1: Identifying reusable solutions for the PA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The administration identifies the candidate 'reusable PA solutions' that
meet its requirements. The activities anticipated in this phase are:

-  a search for 'reusable PA solutions' that currently exist within the
   Developers Italia platform.

This phase concludes with the:

-  identification of 'reusable PA solutions' of interest to the public
   administration.

Phase 2.2: Assessment of reusable solutions for the PA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whereas the previous phase 2.1 made it possible to identify at least one
‘reusable PA solution' of potential interest to the public
administration, through the implementation of this assessment phase the
best 'reusable PA solution’ shall be identified. Solutions that meet the
majority of needs and require modifications or customisation are also
eligible at this stage.

For each of the potential 'reusable PA solutions’ of interest, steps
shall be taken to:

-  check that at the very least, they conform to the regulations in
   force, which are detailed on the software data sheet in Developers
   Italia. In particular:

   -  compliance with the interoperability rules prescribed by the
      guidelines issued in implementation of Article 73 of the CAD;

   -  compliance with data protection regulations;

   -  compliance with minimum levels of security for public
      administrations.

   -  compliance with accessibility requirements (Law No 4/2004).

-  assess the quality of the solution through the following parameters,
   some of which can be found on the software data sheet in Developers
   Italia:

   -  degree of coverage of functional and non-functional requirements;

   -  the presence of an expert technician for the software in question;

   -  the possible presence of agreements with third parties entered
      into by the owner administration and usable by the assessing
      administration, regarding support activities for the installation
      and/or customisation of the solution or, in any case, the methods
      of use for the solution itself (e.g. a regional in-house may make
      open source software available for its municipalities together
      with an agreement to provide installation and training services);

   -  the presence of mandatory constraints and dependencies with other
      open software and/or proprietary software; for example, open
      source software may require a licence for a proprietary database,
      or it may require a licence for a proprietary API for a cloud
      service;

   -  the presence and level of competence of the internal resources of
      the PA, as regards the management of environments and languages
      used in the solution;

   -  the number and type of other public administrations using the open
      source project;

   -  the viability of the open source project, through the assessment
      of visible indicators on the repository, such as code activity,
      release history, user community, longevity of the project, number
      of unique developers.

-  estimate the Total Cost of Ownership (S:sub:`TCO`) as described in
   `2.7 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) <#_Toc535583343>`__, with
   particular attention paid to:

   -  any software installation costs in the PA cloud or costs for using
      the software through SaaS mode, where present in AgID's Cloud
      Marketplace;

   -  any costs for the training of personnel, including those necessary
      for the training of the parties assigned to the management of the
      solution as well as those for its use by the end-users;

   -  any costs required to integrate the solution with its own systems;

   -  any customisation costs, including those necessary to ensure
      functional and non-functional requirements, not already present in
      the reusable software;

   -  any costs for verifying compliance with the regulations in force.

-  estimate the time for the production of the solution (hereinafter
   S\ :sub:`time`);

-  any other estimates expressing the specificity of the administration.

In order to follow up on the assessment of the above, the public
administration will have to prove that, if not already in its
possession, it is capable of retrieving all the necessary information in
the manner provided for by the regulations.

Therefore, if:

-  The cost (TCO) falls within the established budgetary constraints
   (S:sub:`TCO`\ < T\ :sub:`budget`);

-  Production times are compatible with the estimated times
   (S:sub:`tempi`\ < T\ :sub:`tempi`);

-  Any other impediments are respected.

the administration shall identify the solution best suited to its
requirements on the basis of the assessment carried out. This phase
concludes with the:

-  determination of the best ‘reusable PA solution', or possible absence
   of a solution.

Phase 2.3: Procurement of the reusable solution for the PA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If, following the previous phase 2.2, the administration has determined
a 'reusable PA solution' that meets its requirements, it shall provide
for procurement. The reuse process is described in `3.9 Reuse
of <#_Toc535583366>`__\ `software or use of open source
software <#_Toc535583366>`__.

**The comparative assessment shall be deemed to be complete.**

In the event that the public administration has to bear costs during the
procurement phase (e.g. customisation, installation, training), the
administration shall acquire these services in accordance with
Legislative Decree No 50/2016 and subsequent amendments and additions.
(hereinafter referred to as the *Public Contracts Code*).

Phase 2.4: Identifying open source solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If it is not possible to identify a 'reusable PA solution', the
administration MUST expand its search for solutions, which meet its
requirements, to 'open source solutions', i.e. software released under
an open licence but not owned by a public administration and therefore
not published for reuse. Solutions that meet the majority of needs and
require modifications or customisation are also eligible at this stage.

The activities anticipated in this phase are:

-  identification of open source software projects whose ownership is
   attributed to parties other than public administrations. The
   identification process must be carried out, at the minimum, with the
   tools made available on Developers Italia, and can also be extended
   to other international platforms that manage open source software
   projects.

In identifying a solution, the public administration must verify:

-  if the software licence is among those suggested in this document or
   certified by OSI (`complete
   list <https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical>`__).

-  if the licence is compatible with the software licences that may be
   integrated with it and/or with its intended use;

This phase concludes with the:

-  identification of 'open source solutions' of interest to the public
   administration

Phase 2.5: Assessment of open source solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the previous phase 2.4 has led to the identification of at least one
'open source solution' of potential interest, the best 'open source
solution' for the requirements of the public administration is
identified in the assessment phase.

The assessment of open source software in this phase should follow the
same assessment criteria as described for phase 2.2. Therefore, consider
phase 2.5 as a duplication of phase 2.2, applied to a different set of
software (third-party open source instead of reusable software).

This phase concludes with the:

-  determination of the best 'open source solution', or possible absence
   of a solution.

Phase 2.6: Procurement of the open source solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If, following the previous phase 2.5, the administration has identified
an 'open source solution' that meets its requirements, it shall proceed
with the acquisition. The acquisition process is described in `3.9 Reuse
of <#_Toc535583366>`__\ `software or use of open source
software <#_Toc535583366>`__.

**The comparative assessment shall be deemed to be complete.**

In the event that the public administration has to bear costs during the
procurement phase (e.g. customisation, installation, training), the same
shall acquire these services in accordance with the *Public Contracts
Code*.

Phase 2.7: Impossibility determination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the event that it is impossible to identify a solution that
satisfies, at least to a large extent, the requirements of the
administration, between 'reusable PA solutions' and 'open source
solutions', a document is prepared (without format constrictions) that
justifies the reasons for the ascertained impossibility, which will be
kept with the documents filed for the proceedings.

The public administration continues the comparative assessment exercise
by following up with the phases anticipated within the next
macro-phase 3.
