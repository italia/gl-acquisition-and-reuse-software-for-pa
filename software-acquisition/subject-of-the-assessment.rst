Subject of the assessment
-----------------------------

The comparative assessment should be carried out when public
administrations intend to acquire '*computer programs or parts
thereof*'. Therefore the subject of the assessment is software (as
identified in *1.2. Software covered by these guidelines*) that meets
the specific functional requirements of the administration.

For example, the acquisition of hardware components for information
systems (servers, workstations, printers, etc.) remains outside the
scope of this document.

Further situations where the decision-making process proposed in this
Chapter 2 is not applicable may involve, for example:

-  the adoption of framework contracts already agreed, where such
   adoption is compulsory for administrations;

-  framework agreements, as instruments that exclusively define the
   general clauses that, within a given period of time, regulate the
   contracts to be entered into (the specific characteristics of the
   individual supply are subsequently defined in Specific Contracts);

-  completion of projects or outputs for which a comparative assessment
   has already been carried out prior to the initial acquisition;

-  tenders with the complete outsourcing of information systems as their
   objective, since the option of outsourcing involves a strategic area
   that goes beyond the specific context of these guidelines and
   responds to administration governance decisions and strategic
   objectives of a more general nature.

Please note that in the cases listed here, the Guidelines for software
reuse described in Chapter 3 must still be applied.
