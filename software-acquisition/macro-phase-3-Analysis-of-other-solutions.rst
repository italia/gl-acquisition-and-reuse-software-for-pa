Macro-phase 3: Analysis of other solutions
----------------------------------------------

AAAIn order to satisfy its requirements, the public administration MUST
also examine the opportunities offered by proprietary solutions and
those built from scratch.

Phase 3.1: Identifying proprietary solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The public administration must assess the proprietary solutions
available on the market.

The administration must search for a solution with a proprietary
licence, analysing the offerings in accordance with the Public Contracts
Code.

The administration must verify that the licensed software meets the
following requirements (i.e. **the absence of even one of these makes
the solution ineligible):**

-  compliance with the interoperability rules prescribed by the
   guidelines issued in implementation of Article 73 of the CAD;

-  compliance with data protection regulations;

-  compliance with minimum levels of security for public
   administrations;

-  compliance with accessibility requirements (Law No 4/2004);

-  capacity to export free of charge, at any time, the entire database
   (including any type of index or metadata used to implement the
   functionalities of the software itself) in standard format, open and
   documented, to avoid the occurrence of lock-in, as better specified
   in `ANAC guideline
   No 8 <https://www.anticorruzione.it/portal/public/classic/AttivitaAutorita/ContrattiPubblici/LineeGuida/_lineeGuida8>`__.

Among the software that respects the aforementioned requirements, the
administration carries out a comparative analysis that takes into
account the following criteria:

-  assurance that the functional requirements not determined in
   macro-phase 1 comply with those indicated in the documentation;

-  assessment of the suitability of the solution to interoperate with
   the systems already in use in the administration;

-  any software installation costs in the PA cloud or costs for using
   the software through SaaS mode, where present in AgID's Cloud
   Marketplace;

-  any costs required to integrate the solution with the systems already
   in use by the administration;

-  any costs for training personnel to manage and administer the
   proposed solution;

-  calculation of the TCO and its adherence to the available budget
   determined in the previous macro-phase 1.

This phase concludes with the:

-  identification of solutions with a proprietary user licence that meet
   the requirements of the administration.

Phase 3.2: Analysis of from-scratch solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The public administration, after having identified the existence or not
of a proprietary solution suitable for its requirements, shall prepare a
document containing a feasibility study [1]_ with an estimate of the
activities, costs and time required for the implementation of a solution
from scratch that fully meets the requirements indicated in the document
concerning the analysis of needs, as described in `2.4.1 Phase 1.1:
Needs analysis <#_Toc535583327>`__.

Phase 3.3: Comparison of proprietary and from-scratch solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In making a decision between the development of a from-scratch solution
and the acquisition of a proprietary solution (the so-called 'make or
buy' assessment), the administration assesses the advantages and
disadvantages of both types of solution, using the following list as a
reference point:

**Advantages of acquiring a proprietary solution:**

-  quick commissioning;

-  full guarantee and application risk borne by the supplier;

-  supplier maintenance;

-  lower acquisition or subscription costs than full development;

**Advantages of developing a from-scratch solution:**

-  full compliance with needs and objectives;

-  ease of management (importing and exporting) of data;

-  medium/long-term TCO (Total Cost of Ownership);

-  sharing of the solution and therefore optimisation of the costs of
   sustaining it;

-  extension and updating;

-  *reuse by other administrations.*

**Disadvantages of a proprietary solution:**

-  periodic licences (monthly, annual subscriptions) or paid version
   updates;

-  rigidity of the operative flow or inability to adapt to the
   operational organisation of the public administration;

-  possibility of lock-in, i.e. excessive costs of changing the solution
   in the future;

-  economic stability of the supplier.

**Disadvantages of a from-scratch solution:**

-  more tasks to execute;

-  greater need for coordination;

-  longer commissioning times.

Phase 3.4: Procurement of proprietary or from-scratch solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following on from the previous phase 3.3, the administration identifies
a solution, either with a proprietary licence or developed from scratch,
which meets its requirements and provides for the procurement of the
same according to the procedures set out in the Public Contracts Code.

If the from-scratch solution has been chosen, taking into account
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 69 that govern the reuse of software that
will be developed, please refer to `3.7 Developing software from
scratch <#_Toc535583358>`__ for information on how to develop this
solution to comply with the paragraphs mentioned and thus enable it to
be reused.

In the event that proprietary software is acquired under licence, please
note that the administration must, where possible, acquire ownership of
the developed code (as explained in `1.5 Ownership <#_Toc535583316>`__),
so as to enable it to be reused.

**The comparative assessment shall be deemed to be complete.**
