Choice of software provision method
-------------------------------------

If the software (reusable, open source or proprietary) is to be
installed on a server, the administration may find itself considering
the following provision methods:

1. SaaS mode, if the software is available as a SaaS service in the
   Cloud Marketplace and is therefore qualified in accordance with the
   AgID circular '*Criteria for the qualification of SaaS services for
   the PA Cloud*';

2. installation on a server with direct availability for the
   administration.

The choice between these options must be made by calculating the Total
Cost of Ownership as described in Section 2.7. Total Cost of Ownership
(TCO).

According to the provisions of Chapter 3 of the Three-Year Plan for IT
in the PA, in order to install on an available server, the
administration must use the PA Cloud, choosing one of the following IaaS
options:

-  installation in a PSN (Poli Strategici Nazionali - National Strategic
   Centres);

-  installation in a Batch 1 SPC Cloud;

-  installation in Qualified Cloud Service Providers in accordance with
   the AgID circular '*Criteria for the qualification of Cloud Service
   Providers for the PA*'.
